# Scientifica

==

Tall and condensed bitmap font for geeks.


Scientifica is largely based on [creep](https://github.com/romeovs/creep), with a number
of minor tweaks to improve readablity (a matter of taste of course).

Most characters are just 4px wide, which is brilliant for small displays.


### Whats different?

==

A few characters that were changed are:

`V, *, f, W, M `

A full list of changed characters can be found [here](~/images/changes.png).


I will be constantly adding glyphs to this font. Keep a lookout.



### Installation
